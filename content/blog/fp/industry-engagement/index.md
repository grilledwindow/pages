I attended two webinars, Nurturing Next Generation for STEM by the Singapore Computer Society (SCS), and Google I/O by Google. The talk by SCS helped me learn what it takes to be in the tech industry, and the conference by Google showed me that the tech industry just keeps growing.

These two talks have shown me what it means to be in the tech industry, where technological advancements are frequent, and that tech evolves quickly. I have learned what it means to keep up with such an industry by having a clear goal and a plan to reach that goal, connecting with individuals to stay rooted in my passion, and to sharpen my skills non-stop.
