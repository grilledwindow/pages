## Who?
Hi, my name is Xavier. I'm a sentimental and reserved person :) \
I've just finished two dreadful yet wonderful years of NS (woohoo!) \
I underwent a shoulder surgery in July 2025 that'll take months to recover.
So instead of starting uni right after army, I opted to start a year later.
This gap year'll allow me time to recuperate, build projects and explore hobbies.

## What? Why?
Programming is a powerful and versatile skill, the freedom of which I've decided to create projects like this website.
Reflecting on my ventures makes me learn better and makes for good future reference.

This website is also an expression of myself; muted colours for subtlety, minimalism a desire for order.

## Back in My Days...
I tinkered with mobile devices for the purpose of "hacking" games.
I even made YouTube videos about them - impressive for then 10-year-old me.
I guess this is how my interest for technology sparked.

I loved playing around with different Android ROMs as a secondary school kid.
With an increased spending ability, I sometimes tinker with cheaper older models nowadays.
I also learned to code in Python and was amazed with its capabilities and all the potential it had for me.
Hardly containing my excitement, I would "code" on pen and paper during lessons.

Following this passion led to a diploma in Information Technology, a culmination of skills and experiences a mere certificate cannot justify.
It has brought me great joy and satisfaction, so I hope to follow this passion for as long as it is mine :)
